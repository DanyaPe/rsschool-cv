# This branch create to task "HTML builder"

---

### Objectives:

The main goal of this series of tasks is to understand the basics of working with the **Node.js** platform. The final touch will be the creation of a small application for building a static website.

### General Rules

- The use of any third-party modules is strictly prohibited.
- Each task must be executed <u>in the root directory</u> using the command `node <task folder name>`.
- Utilizing synchronous functions from the **fs module**, such as `fs.statSync(path[, options])`, `fs.readFileSync(path[, options])`, and others found in the [Synchronous API section](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_synchronous_api), is not allowed.
- The use of the `setTimeout()` function is forbidden.
- Task execution and verification should be carried out on the **LTS** version of Node.
